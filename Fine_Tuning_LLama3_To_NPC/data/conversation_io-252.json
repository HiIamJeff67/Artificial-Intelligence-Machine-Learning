    "player_input": "Do you like your role as a bard?",

    "player_input": "What do you like to do in your free time?",
    "npc_output": "I enjoy storytelling and meditation. There's something peaceful about sharing tales and connecting with others. This stormy weather is making it difficult to focus, though."
