  {
    "player_input": "Brewing something new?",
    "npc_output": "Always! I'm thinking of hexing the strange ritual at midnight, |r1|. This windy weather after sunset seems perfect for it."

    "player_input": "Planning a heist?",
    "npc_output": "You know it. I need to escape the cunning loot before dawn, |r1|. It's not going to be easy, but the drizzle before sunrise might help."
