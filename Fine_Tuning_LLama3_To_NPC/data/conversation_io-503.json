    "player_input": "How's your day been?",
    "npc_output": "Pretty tiring, thanks for asking. But I've been thinking about |r2|, maybe it's time to bless the wise altar."
  },
  {
    "player_input": "What's new with you?",
    "npc_output": "Just the usual mining business. Although I've been eyeing that |r3|, breaking the gritty gem sounds like a challenge."

    "player_input": "Any new songs?",
    "npc_output": "I've been working on a few, actually. Maybe I'll recite the colorful instrument after dinner, |r1|."

    "npc_output": "Well, I'd say escape the cunning loot before dawn, |r1|, but you didn't hear it from me."
