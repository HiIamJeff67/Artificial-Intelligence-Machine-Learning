## This Project Repository is for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

- The lab homeworks for Artificial Intelligence:

  - Lab1 - Basic Artificial Intelligence (`Basic_Artificial_Intelligence/`)
  - Lab2 - 16 Puzzle Solver (`16_Puzzle_Solver/`)
  - Lab3 - Pacman Agents (`Pacman_Agents/`)
  - Lab4 - 8 Queen Solver (`8_Queens_Solver/`)

- The lab homeworks for Machine Learning:

  - Lab1 - Basic Machine Learning (`Basic_Machine_Learning/`)
  - Lab2 - Implement a Naive Bayers Classifier with Tensorflow 
  (`Implement_Naive_Bayers_Classifier/`)
  - Lab3 - Tree Classifiers (`Tree_Classifiers/`)
  - Lab4 - Multi-Layer Perceptron (`Multi_Layer_Perceptron/`)
  - Lab5 - Face Detection And Recognition (`Face_Detection_And_Recognition/`)

### Note that the .pdf file inside each lab folders are the report for the corresponding lab

### The dataset of "Lab5 - Face Detection And Recognition" is downloaded here:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset, I can't upload it to the github since the filename inside it is too long to be acceptable by github
